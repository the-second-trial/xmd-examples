Read the description on each single exercise, and provide a solution.

## Holomorphy
After introducing the definition of _Holomorphy_, prove that $f$ is holomorphic:

$$
f(z) = \frac{e^z}{1+z^3}
$$

## Integration
Compute the value of the following integral:

$$
\int_\gamma ze^{\frac{1}{z}} dz
$$

Where $\gamma$ is a directed curve describing a clockwise semi-circle centered in the origin with radius $r = \sqrt{2}$.

## The Residue Theorem
Compute the value of the following integral by using the _Residue Theorem_:

$$
\oint_\gamma \log \frac{1}{z} dz
$$

Where $\gamma$ is a closed curve around the origin.

## Laurent Series
Compute the _Laurent Expansion_ in $z_0 = \sqrt{i}$ of the following function:

$$
f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^2 + 1}
$$

And identify the ROC.
