Read the description on each single exercise, and provide a solution.

## Continuity
Evaluate whether function $f$ is continuous in $x = 0$:

$$
f(x) = \frac{\sin{x}}{x}
$$

If deemed non-continuous, expand on the nature of the discontinuity.

### Solution {{if=solutions}}
The solution is here.

## Limits
Compute the value of the following limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\sin{x}}{x - 1}
$$

### Solution {{if=solutions}}
The solution is here.

## Differentiation
Compute the first order derivative of $f$:

$$
f(x) = \log{\left(\frac{1}{\sin{x}}\right)}
$$

### Solution {{if=solutions}}
The solution is here.

## Integration
Compute the following integral:

$$
\int_1^2 \frac{1}{\log{x}} dx
$$

### Solution {{if=solutions}}
The solution is here.
